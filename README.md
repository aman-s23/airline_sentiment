# airline_sentiment

 Here we are performing sentimental analysis on airline data.
 So we are performing data preprossessing on the data and since it is a text data , we'll be using NLP techniques like countvectorizer and Tfidf vectorizer to perform prepossessing.
 Here we are using Logistic regression to train the model and its giving the accuracy of 91%, though we trained the model on naive bayes classifier but the accuracy was not that good compare to Logistic Regression.
 After that we are making a pipeline and predicting some results on it to check how its performing.
 We are using flask to make api request and using html for making web interface.
